 * **algorithm.php** Main class this controls and orchestrates the setup and configuration of the GA
 * **fitnessCalc.php**  class has the fittness calculation logic to determine which individuals are "fit"
 * **indiviudal.php**  class has the code for for setting up an individual composed of chromosones
 * **population.php**  class has the code for for managaing groups of  individuals

The other files are for providing an interfaces for the GA code to be run.
The other files are the ones that allow you to view the genetc algorthim with some sort of interface. Two types provided a web version..
 **ga_sse_demo.html**  : PRovides the web page to view a simple string interface
 **ga_sse_server.php** : Runs the GA algortihm on the server and sends via Server Side events results to ga_See_demo.html

 ga.php Provides command line running of genetic algortihm
